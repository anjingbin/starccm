 *
 * tuplestore.c
 *	  Generalized routines for temporary tuple storage.
 *
 * This module handles temporary storage of tuples for purposes such
 * as Materialize nodes, hashjoin batch files, etc.  It is essentially
 * a dumbed-down version of tuplesort.c; it does no sorting of tuples
 * but can only store a sequence of tuples and regurgitate it later.
 * A temporary file is used to handle the data if it exceeds the
 * space limit specified by the caller.
 *
 * The (approximate) amount of memory allowed to the tuplestore is specified
 * in kilobytes by the caller.	We absorb tuples and simply store them in an
 * in-memory array as long as we haven't exceeded maxKBytes.  If we reach the
 * end of the input without exceeding maxKBytes, we just return tuples during
 * the read phase by scanning the tuple array sequentially.  If we do exceed
 * maxKBytes, we dump all the tuples into a temp file and then read from that
 * during the read phase.
 *
 * When the caller requests random access to the data, we write the temp file
 * in a format that allows either forward or backward scan.

/*--------------------
 *
 * NOTES about on-tape representation of tuples:
 *
 * We require the first "unsigned int" of a stored tuple to be the total size
 * on-tape of the tuple, including itself (so it is never zero; an all-zero
 * unsigned int is used to delimit runs).  The remainder of the stored tuple
 * may or may not match the in-memory representation of the tuple ---
 * any conversion needed is the job of the writetup and readtup routines.
 *
 * If state->randomAccess is true, then the stored representation of the
 * tuple must be followed by another "unsigned int" that is a copy of the
 * length --- so the total tape space used is actually sizeof(unsigned int)
 * more than the stored length value.  This allows read-backwards.	When
 * randomAccess is not true, the write/read routines may omit the extra
 * length word.
 *
 * writetup is expected to write both length words as well as the tuple
 * data.  When readtup is called, the tape is positioned just after the
 * front length word; readtup must read the tuple data and advance past
 * the back length word (if present).
 *
 * The write/read routines can make use of the tuple description data
 * stored in the Tuplestorestate record, if needed. They are also expected
 * to adjust state->availMem by the amount of memory space (not tape space!)
 * released or consumed.  There is no error return from either writetup
 * or readtup; they should elog() on failure.
 *
 *
 * NOTES about memory consumption calculations:
 *
 * We count space requested for tuples against the maxKBytes limit.
 * Fixed-size space (primarily the BufFile I/O buffer) is not
 * counted, nor do we count the variable-size memtuples array.
 * (Even though that could grow pretty large, it should be small compared
 * to the tuples proper, so this is not unreasonable.)
 *
 * The major deficiency in this approach is that it ignores palloc overhead.
 * The memory space actually allocated for a palloc chunk is always more
 * than the request size, and could be considerably more (as much as 2X
 * larger, in the current aset.c implementation).  So the space used could
 * be considerably more than maxKBytes says.
 *
 * One way to fix this is to add a memory management function that, given
 * a pointer to a palloc'd chunk, returns the actual space consumed by the
 * chunk.  This would be very easy in the current aset.c module, but I'm
 * hesitant to do it because it might be unpleasant to support in future
 * implementations of memory management.  (For example, a direct
 * implementation of palloc as malloc could not support such a function
 * portably.)
 *
 * A cruder answer is just to apply a fudge factor, say by initializing
 * availMem to only three-quarters of what maxKBytes indicates.  This is
 * probably the right answer if anyone complains that maxKBytes is not being
 * obeyed very faithfully.
