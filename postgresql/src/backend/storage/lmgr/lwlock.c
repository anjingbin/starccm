 *	  Lightweight lock manager
 *
 * Lightweight locks are intended primarily to provide mutual exclusion of
 * access to shared-memory data structures.  Therefore, they offer both
 * exclusive and shared lock modes (to support read/write and read-only
 * access to a shared object).	There are few other frammishes.  User-level
 * locking should be done with the full lock manager --- which depends on
 * an LWLock to protect its shared state.
