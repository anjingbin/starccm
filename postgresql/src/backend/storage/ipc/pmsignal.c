 * The postmaster is signaled by its children by sending SIGUSR1.  The
 * specific reason is communicated via flags in shared memory.	We keep
 * a boolean flag for each possible "reason", so that different reasons
 * can be signaled by different backends at the same time.	(However,
 * if the same reason is signaled more than once simultaneously, the
 * postmaster will observe it only once.)
 *
 * The flags are actually declared as "volatile sig_atomic_t" for maximum
 * portability.  This should ensure that loads and stores of the flag
 * values are atomic, allowing us to dispense with any explicit locking.
