 *		the target pages is pinned into the cache.
 *
 *		This is called by DROP TABLE to clear buffers for the relation
 *		from the buffer pool.  Note that we must write dirty buffers,
 *		rather than just dropping the changes, because our transaction
 *		might abort later on; we want to roll back safely in that case.
 *
 *		This is also called by VACUUM before truncating the relation to the
 *		given number of blocks.  It might seem unnecessary for VACUUM to
 *		write dirty pages before firstDelBlock, since VACUUM should already
 *		have committed its changes.  However, it is possible for there still
 *		to be dirty pages: if some page had unwritten on-row tuple status
 *		updates from a prior transaction, and VACUUM had no additional
 *		changes to make to that page, then VACUUM won't have written it.
 *		This is harmless in most cases but will break pg_upgrade, which
 *		relies on VACUUM to ensure that *all* tuples have correct on-row
 *		status.  So, we check and flush all dirty pages of the rel
 *		regardless of block number.
 *
 *		In all cases, the caller should be holding AccessExclusiveLock on
 *		the target relation to ensure that no other backend is busy reading
 *		more blocks of the relation (or might do so before we commit).
 *
 *		Formerly, we considered it an error condition if we found dirty
 *		buffers here.	However, since BufferSync no longer forces out all
 *		dirty buffers at every xact commit, it's possible for dirty buffers
 *		to still be present in the cache due to failure of an earlier
 *		transaction.  So, must flush dirty buffers without complaint.
 *
 *		Returns: 0 - Ok, -1 - FAILED TO WRITE DIRTY BUFFER, -2 - PINNED
