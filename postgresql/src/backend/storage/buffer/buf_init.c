/*
 * Data Structures:
 *		buffers live in a freelist and a lookup data structure.
 *
 *
 * Buffer Lookup:
 *		Two important notes.  First, the buffer has to be
 *		available for lookup BEFORE an IO begins.  Otherwise
 *		a second process trying to read the buffer will
 *		allocate its own copy and the buffer pool will
 *		become inconsistent.
 *
 * Buffer Replacement:
 *		see freelist.c.  A buffer cannot be replaced while in
 *		use either by data manager or during IO.
 *
 * WriteBufferBack:
 *		currently, a buffer is only written back at the time
 *		it is selected for replacement.  It should
 *		be done sooner if possible to reduce latency of
 *		BufferAlloc().	Maybe there should be a daemon process.
 *
 * Synchronization/Locking:
 *
 * BufMgrLock lock -- must be acquired before manipulating the
 *		buffer queues (lookup/freelist).  Must be released
 *		before exit and before doing any IO.
 *
 * IO_IN_PROGRESS -- this is a flag in the buffer descriptor.
 *		It must be set when an IO is initiated and cleared at
 *		the end of	the IO.  It is there to make sure that one
 *		process doesn't start to use a buffer while another is
 *		faulting it in.  see IOWait/IOSignal.
 *
 * refcount --	A buffer is pinned during IO and immediately
 *		after a BufferAlloc().	A buffer is always either pinned
 *		or on the freelist but never both.	The buffer must be
 *		released, written, or flushed before the end of
 *		transaction.
 *
 * PrivateRefCount -- Each buffer also has a private refcount the keeps
 *		track of the number of times the buffer is pinned in the current
 *		processes.	This is used for two purposes, first, if we pin a
 *		a buffer more than once, we only need to change the shared refcount
 *		once, thus only lock the buffer pool once, second, when a transaction
 *		aborts, it should only unpin the buffers exactly the number of times it
 *		has pinned them, so that it will not blow away buffers of another
 *		backend.
