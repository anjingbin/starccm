 * NOTES
 *	  This cruft is the server side of PQfn.
 *
 *	  - jolly 07/11/95:
 *
 *	  no longer rely on return sizes provided by the frontend.	Always
 *	  use the true lengths for the catalogs.  Assume that the frontend
 *	  has allocated enough space to handle the result value returned.
 *
 *	  trust that the user knows what he is doing with the args.  If the
 *	  sys catalog says it is a varlena, assume that the user is only sending
 *	  down VARDATA and that the argsize is the VARSIZE.  If the arg is
 *	  fixed len, assume that the argsize given by the user is correct.
 *
 *	  if the function returns by value, then only send 4 bytes value
 *	  back to the frontend.  If the return returns by reference,
 *	  send down only the data portion and set the return size appropriately.
 *
 *	 OLD COMMENTS FOLLOW
 *
 *	  The VAR_LENGTH_{ARGS,RESULT} stuff is limited to MAX_STRING_LENGTH
 *	  (see src/backend/tmp/fastpath.h) for no obvious reason.  Since its
 *	  primary use (for us) is for Inversion path names, it should probably
 *	  be increased to 256 (MAXPATHLEN for Inversion, hidden in pg_type
 *	  as well as utils/adt/filename.c).
 *
 *	  Quoth PMA on 08/15/93:
 *
 *	  This code has been almost completely rewritten with an eye to
 *	  keeping it as compatible as possible with the previous (broken)
 *	  implementation.
 *
 *	  The previous implementation would assume (1) that any value of
 *	  length <= 4 bytes was passed-by-value, and that any other value
 *	  was a struct varlena (by-reference).	There was NO way to pass a
 *	  fixed-length by-reference argument (like name) or a struct
 *	  varlena of size <= 4 bytes.
 *
 *	  The new implementation checks the catalogs to determine whether
 *	  a value is by-value (type "0" is null-delimited character string,
 *	  as it is for, e.g., the parser).	The only other item obtained
 *	  from the catalogs is whether or not the value should be placed in
 *	  a struct varlena or not.	Otherwise, the size given by the
 *	  frontend is assumed to be correct (probably a bad decision, but
 *	  we do strange things in the name of compatibility).

	 *
	 * We really do not want to elog() before having swallowed all of the
	 * frontend's fastpath message; otherwise we will lose sync with the
	 * input datastream.  What should happen is we absorb all of the input
	 * message per protocol syntax, and *then* do error checking
	 * (including lookup of the given function ID) and elog if
	 * appropriate.  Unfortunately, because we cannot even read the
	 * message properly without knowing whether the data types are
	 * pass-by-ref or pass-by-value, it's not all that easy to do :-(. The
	 * protocol should require the client to supply what it thinks is the
	 * typbyval and typlen value for each arg, so that we can read the
	 * data without having to do any lookups.  Then after we've read the
	 * message, we should do the lookups, verify agreement of the actual
	 * function arg types with what we received, and finally call the
	 * function.
	 *
	 * As things stand, not only will we lose sync for an invalid message
	 * (such as requested function OID doesn't exist), but we may lose
	 * sync for a perfectly valid message if we are in transaction-aborted
	 * state! This can happen because our database lookup attempts may
	 * fail entirely in abort state.
	 *
	 * Unfortunately I see no way to fix this without breaking a lot of
	 * existing clients.  Maybe do it as part of next protocol version
	 * change.
