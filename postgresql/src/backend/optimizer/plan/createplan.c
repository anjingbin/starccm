 * the original relation, it is no longer equal() to an unmodified Var node
 * for the same var.  So, we cannot easily compare reference-adjusted qual
 * clauses to clauses that have not been adjusted.	Fortunately, that
 * doesn't seem to be necessary; all the decisions are made before we do
 * the reference adjustments.
 *
 * A cleaner solution would be to not call join_references() here at all,
 * but leave it for setrefs.c to do at the end of plan tree construction.
 * But that would make switch_outer() much more complicated, and some care
 * would be needed to get setrefs.c to do the right thing with nestloop

/*
 * fix_indxqual_references
 *	  Adjust indexqual clauses to the form the executor's indexqual
 *	  machinery needs, and check for recheckable (lossy) index conditions.
 *
 * We have four tasks here:
 *	* Index keys must be represented by Var nodes with varattno set to the
 *	  index's attribute number, not the attribute number in the original rel.
 *	* indxpath.c may have selected an index that is binary-compatible with
 *	  the actual expression operator, but not exactly the same datatype.
 *	  We must replace the expression's operator with the binary-compatible
 *	  equivalent operator that the index will recognize.
 *	* If the index key is on the right, commute the clause to put it on the
 *	  left.  (Someday the executor might not need this, but for now it does.)
 *	* If the indexable operator is marked 'amopreqcheck' in pg_amop, then
 *	  the index is "lossy" for this operator: it may return more tuples than
 *	  actually satisfy the operator condition.	For each such operator, we
 *	  must add (the original form of) the indexqual clause to the "qpquals"
 *	  of the indexscan node, where the operator will be re-evaluated to
 *	  ensure it passes.
 *
 * This code used to be entirely bogus for multi-index scans.  Now it keeps
 * track of which index applies to each subgroup of index qual clauses...
 *
 * Both the input list and the output lists have the form of lists of sublists
 * of qual clauses --- the top-level list has one entry for each indexscan
 * to be performed.  The semantics are OR-of-ANDs.
 *
 * fixed_indexquals receives a modified copy of the indexqual list --- the
 * original is not changed.  Note also that the copy shares no substructure
 * with the original; this is needed in case there is a subplan in it (we need
 * two separate copies of the subplan tree, or things will go awry).
 *
 * recheck_indexquals similarly receives a full copy of whichever clauses
 * need rechecking.
