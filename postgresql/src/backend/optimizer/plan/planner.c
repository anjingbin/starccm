/*---------------
 * make_subplanTargetList

 *
 * When grouping_planner inserts Aggregate and/or Group plan nodes above
 * the result of query_planner, we typically want to pass a different
 * target list to query_planner than the outer plan nodes should have.
 * This routine generates the correct target list for the subplan.
 *
 * The initial target list passed from the parser already contains entries
 * for all ORDER BY and GROUP BY expressions, but it will not have entries
 * for variables used only in HAVING clauses; so we need to add those
 * variables to the subplan target list.  Also, if we are doing either
 * grouping or aggregation, we flatten all expressions except GROUP BY items
 * into their component variables; the other expressions will be computed by
 * the inserted nodes rather than by the subplan.  For example,
 * given a query like
 *		SELECT a+b,SUM(c+d) FROM table GROUP BY a+b;
 * we want to pass this targetlist to the subplan:
 *		a,b,c,d,a+b
 * where the a+b target will be used by the Sort/Group steps, and the
 * other targets will be used for computing the final results.	(In the
 * above example we could theoretically suppress the a and b targets and
 * pass down only c,d,a+b, but it's not really worth the trouble to
 * eliminate simple var references from the subplan.  We will avoid doing
 * the extra computation to recompute a+b at the outer level; see
 * replace_vars_with_subplan_refs() in setrefs.c.)
 *
 * 'parse' is the query being processed.
 * 'tlist' is the query's target list.
 * 'groupColIdx' receives an array of column numbers for the GROUP BY
 * expressions (if there are any) in the subplan's target list.
