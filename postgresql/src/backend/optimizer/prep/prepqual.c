/*****************************************************************************
 *
 *		CNF/DNF CONVERSION ROUTINES
 *
 *		These routines convert an arbitrary boolean expression into
 *		conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form.
 *
 *		Normalization is only carried out in the top AND/OR/NOT portion
 *		of the given tree; we do not attempt to normalize boolean expressions
 *		that may appear as arguments of operators or functions in the tree.
 *
 *		Query qualifications (WHERE clauses) are ordinarily transformed into
 *		CNF, ie, AND-of-ORs form, because then the optimizer can use any one
 *		of the independent AND clauses as a filtering qualification.  However,
 *		quals that are naturally expressed as OR-of-ANDs can suffer an
 *		exponential growth in size in this transformation, so we also consider
 *		converting to DNF (OR-of-ANDs), and we may also leave well enough alone
 *		if both transforms cause unreasonable growth.  The OR-of-ANDs format
 *		is useful for indexscan implementation, so we prefer that format when
 *		there is just one relation involved.
 *
 *		canonicalize_qual() does "smart" conversion to either CNF or DNF, per
 *		the above considerations, while cnfify() and dnfify() simply perform
 *		the demanded transformation.  The latter two may become dead code
 *		eventually.
