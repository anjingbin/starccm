/* ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *				hash-join hash table structures
 *
 * Each active hashjoin has a HashJoinTable control block which is
 * palloc'd in the executor's per-query context.  All other storage needed
 * for the hashjoin is kept in private memory contexts, two for each hashjoin.
 * This makes it easy and fast to release the storage when we don't need it
 * anymore.
 *
 * The hashtable contexts are made children of the per-query context, ensuring
 * that they will be discarded at end of statement even if the join is
 * aborted early by an error.  (Likewise, any temporary files we make will
 * be cleaned up by the virtual file manager in event of an error.)
 *
 * Storage that should live through the entire join is allocated from the
 * "hashCxt", while storage that is only wanted for the current batch is
 * allocated in the "batchCxt".  By resetting the batchCxt at the end of
 * each batch, we free all the per-batch storage reliably and without tedium.
