 * Resdom (Result Domain)
 *
 * Notes:
 * ressortgroupref is the parse/plan-time representation of ORDER BY and
 * GROUP BY items.	Targetlist entries with ressortgroupref=0 are not
 * sort/group items.  If ressortgroupref>0, then this item is an ORDER BY or
 * GROUP BY value.	No two entries in a targetlist may have the same nonzero
 * ressortgroupref --- but there is no particular meaning to the nonzero
 * values, except as tags.	(For example, one must not assume that lower
 * ressortgroupref means a more significant sort key.)	The order of the
 * associated SortClause or GroupClause lists determine the semantics.
 *
 * reskey and reskeyop are the execution-time representation of sorting.
 * reskey must be zero in any non-sort-key item.  The reskey of sort key
 * targetlist items for a sort plan node is 1,2,...,n for the n sort keys.
 * The reskeyop of each such targetlist item is the sort operator's OID.
 * reskeyop will be zero in non-sort-key items.
 *
 * Both reskey and reskeyop are typically zero during parse/plan stages.
 * The executor does not pay any attention to ressortgroupref.

/* ----------------
 * SubLink
 *
 * A SubLink represents a subselect appearing in an expression, and in some
 * cases also the combining operator(s) just above it.	The subLinkType
 * indicates the form of the expression represented:
 *	EXISTS_SUBLINK		EXISTS(SELECT ...)
 *	ALL_SUBLINK			(lefthand) op ALL (SELECT ...)
 *	ANY_SUBLINK			(lefthand) op ANY (SELECT ...)
 *	MULTIEXPR_SUBLINK	(lefthand) op (SELECT ...)
 *	EXPR_SUBLINK		(SELECT with single targetlist item ...)
 * For ALL, ANY, and MULTIEXPR, the lefthand is a list of expressions of the
 * same length as the subselect's targetlist.  MULTIEXPR will *always* have
 * a list with more than one entry; if the subselect has just one target
 * then the parser will create an EXPR_SUBLINK instead (and any operator
 * above the subselect will be represented separately).  Note that both
 * MULTIEXPR and EXPR require the subselect to deliver only one row.
 * ALL, ANY, and MULTIEXPR require the combining operators to deliver boolean
 * results.  These are reduced to one result per row using OR or AND semantics
 * depending on the "useor" flag.  ALL and ANY combine the per-row results
 * using AND and OR semantics respectively.
 *
 * NOTE: lefthand and oper have varying meanings depending on where you look
 * in the parse/plan pipeline:
 * 1. gram.y delivers a list of the (untransformed) lefthand expressions in
 *	  lefthand, and sets oper to a single A_Expr (not a list!) containing
 *	  the string name of the operator, but no arguments.
 * 2. The parser's expression transformation transforms lefthand normally,
 *	  and replaces oper with a list of Oper nodes, one per lefthand
 *	  expression.  These nodes represent the parser's resolution of exactly
 *	  which operator to apply to each pair of lefthand and targetlist
 *	  expressions.	However, we have not constructed actual Expr trees for
 *	  these operators yet.	This is the representation seen in saved rules
 *	  and in the rewriter.
 * 3. Finally, the planner converts the oper list to a list of normal Expr
 *	  nodes representing the application of the operator(s) to the lefthand
 *	  expressions and values from the inner targetlist.  The inner
 *	  targetlist items are represented by placeholder Param or Const nodes.
 *	  The lefthand field is set to NIL, since its expressions are now in
 *	  the Expr list.  This representation is passed to the executor.
 *
 * Planner routines that might see either representation 2 or 3 can tell
 * the difference by checking whether lefthand is NIL or not.  Also,
 * representation 2 appears in a "bare" SubLink, while representation 3 is
 * found in SubLinks that are children of SubPlan nodes.
 *
 * In EXISTS and EXPR SubLinks, both lefthand and oper are unused and are
 * always NIL.	useor is not significant either for these sublink types.

 *	ArrayRef: describes an array subscripting operation
 *
 * An ArrayRef can describe fetching a single element from an array,
 * fetching a subarray (array slice), storing a single element into
 * an array, or storing a slice.  The "store" cases work with an
 * initial array value and a source value that is inserted into the
 * appropriate part of the array; the result of the operation is an
 * entire new modified array value.
 *
 * If reflowerindexpr = NIL, then we are fetching or storing a single array
 * element at the subscripts given by refupperindexpr.	Otherwise we are
 * fetching or storing an array slice, that is a rectangular subarray
 * with lower and upper bounds given by the index expressions.
 * reflowerindexpr must be the same length as refupperindexpr when it
 * is not NIL.
 *
 * Note: array types can be fixed-length (refattrlength > 0), but only
 * when the element type is itself fixed-length.  Otherwise they are
 * varlena structures and have refattrlength = -1.	In any case,
 * an array type is never pass-by-value.
 *
 * Note: currently, refelemtype is NOT the element type, but the array type,
 * when doing subarray fetch or either type of store.  It would be cleaner
 * to add more fields so we can distinguish the array element type from the
 * result type of the ArrayRef operator...

 *					node types for join trees
 *
 * The leaves of a join tree structure are RangeTblRef nodes.  Above
 * these, JoinExpr nodes can appear to denote a specific kind of join
 * or qualified join.  Also, FromExpr nodes can appear to denote an
 * ordinary cross-product join ("FROM foo, bar, baz WHERE ...").
 * FromExpr is like a JoinExpr of jointype JOIN_INNER, except that it
 * may have any number of child nodes, not just two.  Also, there is an
 * implementation-defined difference: the planner is allowed to join the
 * children of a FromExpr using whatever join order seems good to it.
 * At present, JoinExpr nodes are always joined in exactly the order
 * implied by the jointree structure (except the planner may choose to
 * swap inner and outer members of a join pair).
 *
 * NOTE: the top level of a Query's jointree is always a FromExpr.
 * Even if the jointree contains no rels, there will be a FromExpr.
 *
 * NOTE: the qualification expressions present in JoinExpr nodes are
 * *in addition to* the query's main WHERE clause, which appears as the
 * qual of the top-level FromExpr.	The reason for associating quals with
 * specific nodes in the jointree is that the position of a qual is critical
 * when outer joins are present.  (If we enforce a qual too soon or too late,
 * that may cause the outer join to produce the wrong set of NULL-extended
 * rows.)  If all joins are inner joins then all the qual positions are
 * semantically interchangeable.
 *
 * NOTE: in the raw output of gram.y, a join tree contains RangeVar and
 * RangeSubselect nodes, which are both replaced by RangeTblRef nodes
 * during the parse analysis phase.  Also, the top-level FromExpr is added
 * during parse analysis; the grammar regards FROM and WHERE as separate.

 *
 * alias is an Attr node representing the AS alias-clause attached to the
 * join expression, or NULL if no clause.  NB: presence or absence of the
 * alias has a critical impact on semantics, because a join with an alias
 * restricts visibility of the tables/columns inside it.
 *
 * During parse analysis, colnames is filled with a list of String nodes
