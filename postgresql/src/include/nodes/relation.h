/*----------
 * RelOptInfo
 *		Per-relation information for planning/optimization
 *
 *		For planning purposes, a "base rel" is either a plain relation (a
 *		table) or the output of a sub-SELECT that appears in the range table.
 *		In either case it is uniquely identified by an RT index.  A "joinrel"
 *		is the joining of two or more base rels.  A joinrel is identified by
 *		the set of RT indexes for its component baserels.
 *
 *		Note that there is only one joinrel for any given set of component
 *		baserels, no matter what order we assemble them in; so an unordered
 *		set is the right datatype to identify it with.
 *
 *		Parts of this data structure are specific to various scan and join
 *		mechanisms.  It didn't seem worth creating new node types for them.
 *
 *		relids - List of base-relation identifiers; it is a base relation
 *				if there is just one, a join relation if more than one
 *		rows - estimated number of tuples in the relation after restriction
 *			   clauses have been applied (ie, output rows of a plan for it)
 *		width - avg. number of bytes per tuple in the relation after the
 *				appropriate projections have been done (ie, output width)
 *		targetlist - List of TargetEntry nodes for the attributes we need
 *					 to output from this relation
 *		pathlist - List of Path nodes, one for each potentially useful
 *				   method of generating the relation
 *		cheapest_startup_path - the pathlist member with lowest startup cost
 *								(regardless of its ordering)
 *		cheapest_total_path - the pathlist member with lowest total cost
 *							  (regardless of its ordering)
 *		pruneable - flag to let the planner know whether it can prune the
 *					pathlist of this RelOptInfo or not.
 *
 *	 * If the relation is a base relation it will have these fields set:
 *
 *		issubquery - true if baserel is a subquery RTE rather than a table
 *		indexlist - list of IndexOptInfo nodes for relation's indexes
 *					(always NIL if it's a subquery)
 *		pages - number of disk pages in relation (zero if a subquery)
 *		tuples - number of tuples in relation (not considering restrictions)
 *		subplan - plan for subquery (NULL if it's a plain table)
 *
 *		Note: for a subquery, tuples and subplan are not set immediately
 *		upon creation of the RelOptInfo object; they are filled in when
 *		set_base_rel_pathlist processes the object.
 *
 *		Note: if a base relation is the root of an inheritance tree
 *		(SELECT FROM foo*) it is still considered a base rel.  We will
 *		generate a list of candidate Paths for accessing that table itself,
 *		and also generate baserel RelOptInfo nodes for each child table,
 *		with their own candidate Path lists.  Then, an AppendPath is built
 *		from the cheapest Path for each of these tables, and set to be the
 *		only available Path for the inheritance baserel.
 *
 *	 * The presence of the remaining fields depends on the restrictions
 *		and joins that the relation participates in:
 *
 *		baserestrictinfo - List of RestrictInfo nodes, containing info about
 *					each qualification clause in which this relation
 *					participates (only used for base rels)
 *		baserestrictcost - Estimated cost of evaluating the baserestrictinfo
 *					clauses at a single tuple (only used for base rels)
 *		outerjoinset - If the rel appears within the nullable side of an outer
 *					join, the list of all relids participating in the highest
 *					such outer join; else NIL (only used for base rels)
 *		joininfo  - List of JoinInfo nodes, containing info about each join
 *					clause in which this relation participates
 *		innerjoin - List of Path nodes that represent indices that may be used
 *					as inner paths of nestloop joins. This field is non-null
 *					only for base rels, since join rels have no indices.
 *
 * Note: Keeping a restrictinfo list in the RelOptInfo is useful only for
 * base rels, because for a join rel the set of clauses that are treated as
 * restrict clauses varies depending on which sub-relations we choose to join.
 * (For example, in a 3-base-rel join, a clause relating rels 1 and 2 must be
 * treated as a restrictclause if we join {1} and {2 3} to make {1 2 3}; but
 * if we join {1 2} and {3} then that clause will be a restrictclause in {1 2}
 * and should not be processed again at the level of {1 2 3}.)	Therefore,
 * the restrictinfo list in the join case appears in individual JoinPaths
 * (field joinrestrictinfo), not in the parent relation.  But it's OK for
 * the RelOptInfo to store the joininfo lists, because those are the same
 * for a given rel no matter how we form it.
 *
 * We store baserestrictcost in the RelOptInfo (for base relations) because
 * we know we will need it at least once (to price the sequential scan)
 * and may need it multiple times to price index scans.
 *
 * outerjoinset is used to ensure correct placement of WHERE clauses that
 * apply to outer-joined relations; we must not apply such WHERE clauses
 * until after the outer join is performed.

 *		unique	  - true if index is unique
 *
 *		ncolumns and nkeys are the same except for a functional index,

 *		is the number of table columns passed to the function. classlist[]
 *		and ordering[] have ncolumns entries, while indexkeys[] has nkeys
 *		entries.

 * the same tuple more than once, even if it is matched in multiple scans.)
 *
 * 'indexinfo' is a list of IndexOptInfo nodes, one per scan to be performed.
 *
 * 'indexqual' is a list of index qualifications, also one per scan.
 * Each entry in 'indexqual' is a sublist of qualification expressions with
 * implicit AND semantics across the sublist items.  Only expressions that
 * are usable as indexquals (as determined by indxpath.c) may appear here.
 * NOTE that the semantics of the top-level list in 'indexqual' is OR

 *
 * 'indexscandir' is one of:
 *		ForwardScanDirection: forward scan of an ordered index
 *		BackwardScanDirection: backward scan of an ordered index
 *		NoMovementScanDirection: scan of an unordered index, or don't care
 * (The executor doesn't care whether it gets ForwardScanDirection or
 * NoMovementScanDirection for an indexscan, but the planner wants to
 * distinguish ordered from unordered indexes for building pathkeys.)
 *
 * 'joinrelids' is only used in IndexPaths that are constructed for use
 * as the inner path of a nestloop join.  These paths have indexquals
 * that refer to values of other rels, so those other rels must be
 * included in the outer joinrel in order to make a usable join.
 *
 * 'alljoinquals' is also used only for inner paths of nestloop joins.
 * This flag is TRUE iff all the indexquals came from non-pushed-down
 * JOIN/ON conditions, which means the path is safe to use for an outer join.
 *
 * 'rows' is the estimated result tuple count for the indexscan.  This
 * is the same as path.parent->rows for a simple indexscan, but it is
 * different for a nestloop inner path, because the additional indexquals
 * coming from join clauses make the scan more selective than the parent
 * rel's restrict clauses alone would do.

 * ANDed, we can use any one of them or any subset of them to filter out
 * tuples, without having to evaluate the rest.  The RestrictInfo node itself
 * stores data used by the optimizer while choosing the best query plan.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references a single base relation, it will appear
 * in the baserestrictinfo list of the RelOptInfo for that base rel.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references more than one base rel, it will
 * appear in the JoinInfo lists of every RelOptInfo that describes a strict
 * subset of the base rels mentioned in the clause.  The JoinInfo lists are
 * used to drive join tree building by selecting plausible join candidates.
 * The clause cannot actually be applied until we have built a join rel
 * containing all the base rels it references, however.
 *
 * When we construct a join rel that includes all the base rels referenced
 * in a multi-relation restriction clause, we place that clause into the
 * joinrestrictinfo lists of paths for the join rel, if neither left nor
 * right sub-path includes all base rels referenced in the clause.	The clause
 * will be applied at that join level, and will not propagate any further up
 * the join tree.  (Note: the "predicate migration" code was once intended to
 * push restriction clauses up and down the plan tree based on evaluation
 * costs, but it's dead code and is unlikely to be resurrected in the
 * foreseeable future.)
 *
 * Note that in the presence of more than two rels, a multi-rel restriction
 * might reach different heights in the join tree depending on the join
 * sequence we use.  So, these clauses cannot be associated directly with
 * the join RelOptInfo, but must be kept track of on a per-join-path basis.
 *
 * When dealing with outer joins we have to be very careful about pushing qual
 * clauses up and down the tree.  An outer join's own JOIN/ON conditions must
 * be evaluated exactly at that join node, and any quals appearing in WHERE or
 * in a JOIN above the outer join cannot be pushed down below the outer join.
 * Otherwise the outer join will produce wrong results because it will see the
 * wrong sets of input rows.  All quals are stored as RestrictInfo nodes
 * during planning, but there's a flag to indicate whether a qual has been
 * pushed down to a lower level than its original syntactic placement in the
 * join tree would suggest.  If an outer join prevents us from pushing a qual
 * down to its "natural" semantic level (the level associated with just the
 * base rels used in the qual) then the qual will appear in JoinInfo lists
 * that reference more than just the base rels it actually uses.  By
 * pretending that the qual references all the rels appearing in the outer
 * join, we prevent it from being evaluated below the outer join's joinrel.
 * When we do form the outer join's joinrel, we still need to distinguish
 * those quals that are actually in that join's JOIN/ON condition from those
 * that appeared higher in the tree and were pushed down to the join rel
 * because they used no other rels.  That's what the ispusheddown flag is for;
 * it tells us that a qual came from a point above the join of the specific
 * set of base rels that it uses (or that the JoinInfo structures claim it
 * uses).  A clause that originally came from WHERE will *always* have its
 * ispusheddown flag set; a clause that came from an INNER JOIN condition,
 * but doesn't use all the rels being joined, will also have ispusheddown set
 * because it will get attached to some lower joinrel.
 *
 * In general, the referenced clause might be arbitrarily complex.	The
 * kinds of clauses we can handle as indexscan quals, mergejoin clauses,
 * or hashjoin clauses are fairly limited --- the code for each kind of
 * path is responsible for identifying the restrict clauses it can use
 * and ignoring the rest.  Clauses not implemented by an indexscan,
 * mergejoin, or hashjoin will be placed in the plan qual or joinqual field
 * of the finished Plan node, where they will be enforced by general-purpose
 * qual-expression-evaluation code.  (But we are still entitled to count
 * their selectivity when estimating the result tuple count, if we
 * can guess what it is...)
