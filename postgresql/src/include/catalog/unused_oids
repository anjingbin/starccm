#	finds blocks of oids that have not already been claimed by 
#	post_hackers for internal purposes.  primarily useful for
#	finding valid oids for new internal function oids.  the numbers
#	printed are inclusive ranges of valid (unused) oids.
#
#	before using a large empty block, make sure you aren't about
#	to take over what was intended as expansion space for something
#	else.  also, before using a number, do a "grepsrc" to make sure 
#	that someone isn't using a literal numeric constant somewhere..
#
#	non-berkeley post_hackers should probably not try to use oids 
#	less than the highest one that comes with the distributed source.
#
#	run this script in src/include/catalog.
