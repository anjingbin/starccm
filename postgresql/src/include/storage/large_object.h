 * id is the logical OID of the large object
 * offset is the current seek offset within the LO
 * heap_r holds an open-relation reference to pg_largeobject
 * index_r holds an open-relation reference to pg_largeobject_loid_pn_index
 *
 * NOTE: before 7.1, heap_r and index_r held references to the separate
 * table and index of a specific large object.	Now they all live in one rel.

 * Each "page" (tuple) of a large object can hold this much data
 *
 * We could set this as high as BLCKSZ less some overhead, but it seems
 * better to make it a smaller value, so that not as much space is used
 * up when a page-tuple is updated.  Note that the value is deliberately
 * chosen large enough to trigger the tuple toaster, so that we will
 * attempt to compress page tuples in-line.  (But they won't be moved off
 * unless the user creates a toast-table for pg_largeobject...)
 *
 * Also, it seems to be a smart move to make the page size be a power of 2,
 * since clients will often be written to send data in power-of-2 blocks.
 * This avoids unnecessary tuple updates caused by partial-page writes.
