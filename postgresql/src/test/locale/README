$Header: /home/hjcvs/OB-CCM-1.0/postgresql/src/test/locale/README,v 1.2 2004/07/05 08:56:18 SuLiang Exp $

This directory contains a set of tests for locales.  I provided one C
program test-ctype.c to test CTYPE support in libc and the installed
locale data.  Then there are test-sort.pl and test-sort.py that test
collating.

To run a test for some locale run
    gmake check-$locale
for example
    gmake check-koi8-r

Currently, there are only tests for a few locales available.  The script
'runall' calls test-pgsql-locale to test whether locale support has been
compiled into PostgreSQL, test-ctype to test libc and locale data,
test-sort.pl (uncomment test-sort.py, if you have a Python interpreter
installed), and does tests on PostgreSQL with the provided SQL script
files.

To add locale tests one needs to create a directory $locale and create
a Makefile (and other files) similar to koi8-r/*.  Actually, the simplest
(I think) method is just to copy the koi8-r directory and edit/replace
the files.
