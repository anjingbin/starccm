On AIX 4.3.2 PostgreSQL compiled with the native IBM compiler xlc 
(vac.C 5.0.1) passes all regression tests.
Other versions of OS and compiler should also work. If you don't have a 
powerpc or use gcc you might see rounding differences in the geometry
regression test.

Use the following configure flags in addition to your own
if you have readline or libz there:
--with-includes=/usr/local/include --with-libraries=/usr/local/lib

If you need libpq++ and have trouble --with-CXX=xlC make sure you have
installed the appropriate C++ include files and use a C++ version that
supports the string class (e.g. VisualAge C++ filesets vacpp.cmp.batch 5.0
and vacpp.cmp.include 5.0).

There will probably be warnings about 0.0/0.0 division and duplicate symbols 
which you can safely ignore.

Compiling PostgreSQL with gcc (2.95.3) on AIX also works.
Use the configure flags: --with-CC=gcc

Since the mktime() function does not work on AIX for dates before
1970, all localtime formatted datetimes will not use summer time for
dates before 1970.
