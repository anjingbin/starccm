  This chapter needs to be updated for the version-1 function manager

  <para>
   As previously mentioned, there are two kinds of types in
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>: base types (defined in a
   programming language) and composite types. This chapter describes
   how to define new base types.
  </para>

  <para>
   The examples in this section can be found in
   <filename>complex.sql</filename> and <filename>complex.c</filename>
   in the tutorial directory.  Composite examples are in
   <filename>funcs.sql</filename>.
  </para>

  </indexterm>
  A user-defined type must always have input and output functions.
  These functions determine how the type appears in strings (for input
  by the user and output to the user) and how the type is organized in
  memory.  The input function takes a null-terminated character string
  as its input and returns the internal (in memory) representation of
  the type.  The output function takes the internal representation of
  the type and returns a null-terminated character string.
 </para>

 <para>
  Suppose we want to define a complex type which represents complex
  numbers. Naturally, we would choose to represent a complex in memory
  as the following <acronym>C</acronym> structure:

<programlisting>
typedef struct Complex {
    double      x;
    double      y;
} Complex;
</programlisting>

  and  a  string of the form <literal>(x,y)</literal> as the external string
  representation.
 </para>

 <para>
  The functions are usually not hard to write, especially the output
  function.  However, there are a number of points to remember:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     When defining your external (string) representation, remember
     that you must eventually write a complete and robust parser for
     that representation as your input function!
    </para>

    <para>
     For instance:

<programlisting>
Complex *
complex_in(char *str)
{
    double x, y;
    Complex *result;
    if (sscanf(str, " ( %lf , %lf )", &amp;x, &amp;y) != 2) {
        elog(ERROR, "complex_in: error in parsing %s", str);
        return NULL;
    }
    result = (Complex *)palloc(sizeof(Complex));
    result-&gt;x = x;
    result-&gt;y = y;
    return (result);
}
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     The output function can simply be:

<programlisting>
char *
complex_out(Complex *complex)
{
    char *result;
    if (complex == NULL)
        return(NULL);
    result = (char *) palloc(60);
    sprintf(result, "(%g,%g)", complex-&gt;x, complex-&gt;y);
    return(result);
}
</programlisting>

    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     You should try to make the input and output functions inverses of
     each other.  If you do not, you will have severe problems when
     you need to dump your data into a file and then read it back in
     (say, into someone else's database on another computer).  This is
     a particularly common problem when floating-point numbers are
     involved.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </para>

 <para>
  To define the <type>complex</type> type, we need to create the two
  user-defined functions <function>complex_in</function> and
  <function>complex_out</function> before creating the type:

<programlisting>
CREATE FUNCTION complex_in(opaque)
    RETURNS complex
    AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/complex'
    LANGUAGE C;

CREATE FUNCTION complex_out(opaque)
    RETURNS opaque
    AS '<replaceable>PGROOT</replaceable>/tutorial/complex'
    LANGUAGE C;
</programlisting>
 </para>

 <para>
  Finally, we can declare the data type:
<programlisting>
CREATE TYPE complex (
    internallength = 16,
    input = complex_in,
    output = complex_out
);
</programlisting>
 </para>

 <para>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>arrays</primary>
  </indexterm>
  As discussed earlier, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> fully
  supports arrays of base types.  Additionally,
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> supports arrays of
  user-defined types as well.  When you define a type,
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> automatically provides support
  for arrays of that type.  For historical reasons, the array type has
  the same name as the user-defined type with the underscore character
  <literal>_</> prepended.
 </para>

 <para>
  Composite types do not need any function defined on them, since the
  system already understands what they look like inside.
 </para>

 <para>
  <indexterm>
   <primary>TOAST</primary>
   <secondary>and user-defined types</secondary>
  </indexterm>
  If the values of your datatype might exceed a few hundred bytes in
  size (in internal form), you should be careful to mark them
  TOAST-able.  To do this, the internal representation must follow the
  standard layout for variable-length data: the first four bytes must
  be an <type>int32</type> containing the total length in bytes of the
  datum (including itself).  Then, all your functions that accept
  values of the type must be careful to call
  <function>pg_detoast_datum()</function> on the supplied values ---
  after checking that the value is not NULL, if your function is not
  strict.  Finally, select the appropriate storage option when giving
  the <command>CREATE TYPE</command> command.
