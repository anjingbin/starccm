PostgreSQL 7.1 can be built on SCO UnixWare 7 and SCO OpenServer 5.
On OpenServer, you can use either the OpenServer Development Kit or 
the Universal Development Kit.

However, some tweaking may be needed, as described below.

Topics:
*) Skunkware
*) GNU Make
*) Readline
*) Using the UDK on OpenServer
*) Compiling PostgreSQL using the UDK
*) Reading the PostgreSQL man pages


***************************************************************************
*) Skunkware

You should locate your copy of the SCO Skunkware CD.  The Skunkware CD is
included with UnixWare 7 and current versions of OpenServer 5.

Skunkware includes ready-to-install versions of many popular programs that
are available on the Internet.  For example, gzip, gunzip, GNU make, flex,
and bison are all included.

If you do not have this CD, the software on it is available via anonymous
ftp from ftp.sco.com/skunkware.

For UnixWare 7.1, this CD is now labeled "Open License Software Supplement".

Skunkware has different versions for UnixWare and OpenServer.  Make sure
you install the correct version for your operating system, except as noted
below.


***************************************************************************
*) GNU Make

You need to use the GNU make program, which is on the Skunkware CD.  By
default, it installs as /usr/local/bin/make.  To avoid confusion with the
SCO make program, you may want to rename GNU make to gmake.


***************************************************************************
*) Readline

If you install the readline library, then psql (the PostgreSQL command line
SQL interpreter) remembers each command you type, and allows you to use
arrow keys to recall and edit previous commands.  This is very helpful, and
is strongly recommended.  The readline library is on the Skunkware CD.

The readline library is not included on the UnixWare 7.1 Skunkware CD.  If
you have the UnixWare 7.0.0 or 7.0.1 Skunkware CDs, you can install it from
there.  Otherwise, try ftp.sco.com/skunkware.

By default, readline installs into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include.
However, the PostgreSQL configure program will not find it there without
help.  If you installed readline, then use the following options to
configure:

configure --with-libs=/usr/local/lib --with-includes=/usr/local/include


***************************************************************************
*) Using the UDK on OpenServer

If you are using the new Universal Development Kit (UDK) compiler on
OpenServer, you need to specify the locations of the UDK libraries:

configure --with-libs=/udk/usr/lib --with-includes=/udk/usr/include

Putting these together with the readline options from above:

./configure --with-libs="/udk/usr/lib /usr/local/lib" --with-includes="/udk/usr/include /usr/local/include"


***************************************************************************
*) Compiling PostgreSQL 7.1 with the UDK

The program, backend/utils/adt/int8.c, tickles a compiler bug with in the
following versions (and probably others as well) of the C compiler:

	Optimizing C Compilation System  (CCS) 3.2  08/18/98
	Optimizing C Compilation System  (CCS) 3.2  09/28/99 

If you encounter an error compiling backend/utils/adt/int8.c, please apply
the following patch:

------------------------------8< CUT HERE >8------------------------------

  		result = 0;
  	else
! 		for (i = arg1, result = 1; i > 0; --i)
  			result *= i;
  
  	PG_RETURN_INT64(result);
--- 489,495 ----
  	if (arg1 < 1)
  		result = 0;
  	else
! 		for (i = arg1, result = 1; i; --i)
  			result *= i;
  
  	PG_RETURN_INT64(result);
------------------------------8< CUT HERE >8------------------------------

This compiler bug seems to be fixed at least in

	Optimizing C Compilation System  (CCS) 4.0  10/23/00 (UDK FS 7.1.1b) 


***************************************************************************
*) Reading the PostgreSQL man pages

By default, the PostgreSQL man pages are installed into
/usr/local/pgsql/man.  By default, UnixWare does not look there for
man pages.  To be able to read them you need to modify the MANPATH
variable in /etc/default/man.  I use:

	MANPATH=/usr/lib/scohelp/%L/man:/usr/dt/man:/usr/man:/usr/share/man:scohelp:/usr/local/man:/usr/local/pgsql/man

On OpenServer, some extra research needs to be invested to make the
man pages usable, because the man system is a bit different from other
platforms.  Currently, PostgreSQL will not install them at all.
