This is a simple utility that will remove any orphaned large objects out of a
PostgreSQL database.  An orphaned LO is considered to be any LO whose OID
does not appear in any OID data column of the database.


Compiling
--------

Simply run make. A single executable "vacuumlo" is created.


Usage
-----

vacuumlo [-v] database [db2 ... dbn]

The -v flag outputs some progress messages to stdout.


Method
------

First, it builds a temporary table which contains all of the oid's of the
large objects in that database.

It then scans through all columns in the database that are of type 'oid',
and removes any matching entries from the temporary table.

The remaining entries in the temp table identify orphaned LOs.  These are
removed.


Notes
-----

I decided to place this in contrib as it needs further testing, but hopefully,
this (or a variant of it) would make it into the backend as a "vacuum lo"
command in a later release.
