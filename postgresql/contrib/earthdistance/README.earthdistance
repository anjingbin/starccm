Here's the setup for adding an operator '<@>' to give distance in
statute miles between two points on the earth's surface. Coordinates
are in degrees. Points are taken as (longitude, latitude) and not vice
versa as longitude is closer to the intuitive idea of x-axis and
latitude to y-axis.

There's C source, Makefile for FreeBSD, and SQL for installing and
testing the function.

Let me know if anything looks fishy!

A note on testing C extensions - it seems not enough to drop a function
and re-create it - if I change a function, I have to stop and restart
the backend for the new version to be seen. I guess it would be too
messy to track which functions are added from a .so and do a dlclose
when the last one is dropped.
