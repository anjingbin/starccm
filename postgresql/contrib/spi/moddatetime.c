/*
moddatetime.c

What is this?
It is a function to be called from a trigger for the perpose of updating
a modification datetime stamp in a record when that record is UPDATEd.

Credits
This is 95%+ based on autoinc.c, which I used as a starting point as I do
not really know what I am doing.  I also had help from
Jan Wieck <jwieck@debis.com> who told me about the timestamp_in("now") function.
OH, me, I'm Terry Mackintosh <terry@terrym.com>
