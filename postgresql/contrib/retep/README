Before you ask what retepTools are, they are my personal suite of utilities.
About 90% of them are JDBC related (either they use JDBC, or I use them in
developing the JDBC driver).

Now, because of various reasons I won't go into now, in January 2001 I decided
to release the entire lot to the public. I could have used something like
SourceForge, but as they are mainly JDBC related I thought here is the best
place.

Now all (bar retepPDF, see end-note) will over the next few months be going
into the /contrib/retep directory. They range from simple XML Inport/Export
classes to entire sub-systems that can be plugged into applications.

All this lot were never released, so I'm placing them under PostgreSQL's
licence.

Please refer to Implementation for details of what package does what.

It all requires Java2SE (JDK1.2) as a minimum. I do have some plans for some
EJB tools later, so those will need Java2EE, but not yet ;-)

retepPDF: This is not included for two reasons:

1: It's big and not really related in any way to PostgreSQL
2: More importantly, I (may be foolishly) released it some 3 years ago under
   the LGPL. As a few people have added to it, it's not really possible to
   change the licence, and I don't want to polute PostgreSQL's source tree ;-)

retepGraph: This was an old graphics library. It's been obsolete for 3 years
now, so it's not going in.
