//	Notes on our Xerces/Mac paths:
//
//	Wherever paths are used in Xerces, this Macintosh port assumes that they'll
//	be in "unix" format, or at least as close as you can get to that on the particular
//	OS. On classic, this means that a path will be a unix style path, separated by '/' and
//	starting with the Mac OS volume name. Since slash is used as the segment separator,
//	any slashes that actually exist in the segment name will be converted to colons
//	(since colon is the Mac OS path separator and would be illegal in a segment name).
//	For Mac OS X, paths are created and parsed using the FSRefMakePath, etc, routines:
//	the major difference will be location of the volume name within the path.
//
//	The routines below help to create and interpret these pathnames for these cases.
//	While the port itself never creates such paths, it does use these same routines to
//	parse them.

//	Convert fom FSRef/FSSpec to a Unicode character string path.
//	Note that you'll need to delete [] that string after you're done with it!

//	You retain ownership of the pathName.
bool	XMLParsePathToFSRef(const XMLCh* const pathName, FSRef& ref);
bool	XMLParsePathToFSSpec(const XMLCh* const pathName, FSSpec& spec);

//	These routines copy characters between their representation in the Unicode Converter
//	and the representation used by XMLCh. Until a recent change in Xerces, these were
//	sometimes different on the Macintosh (with GCC), but XMLCh is now fixed at 16 bits.
//	Code utilitizing these routines may be phased out in time, as a conversion is no
//	longer necessary.
